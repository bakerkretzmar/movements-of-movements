SUMMARY:Howard Zinn Book Fair
DESCRIPTION:From the Fair’s “about” page: The Howard Zinn Book Fair is an annual celebration of People’s History\, Past Present and Future. We gather together authors\, zinesters\, bloggers and publishers for a day of readings\, panel discussions and workshops exploring the value of dissident histories towards building a better future. In the spirit of the late historian Howard Zinn we recognize the stories of the ways that everyday people have risen to propose a world beyond empires big and small. \n
