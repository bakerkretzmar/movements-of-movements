In early December 2018, I was completing Part 1 of this big two-volume collection of essays, and in his concluding chapter, Laurence Cox’s core message of “listening and learning” and of “being loyal to each other” resonated as I heard news of the angry protests in France against president Emmanuel Macron’s fuel tax.1 The protesters, mostly from rural and low-income areas, were aggrieved because the rise in diesel fuel tax would add to their already considerable financial burdens, but they also were angry because Macron had not been listening to them. Could it be that across the globe, many politicians and even activists who shared Macron’s view of the need to reduce carbon emissions had not been listening or learning from people whose lives had been upended by over 30 years of business-friendly economic policies? Is it a wonder that in France, angry citizens engage in street protests (recall Charles Tilly’s famous book The Contentious French), and in other countries they may vote for right-wing populist parties?
