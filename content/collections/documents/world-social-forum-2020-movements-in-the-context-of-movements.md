        text: 'We are surely living in a “best of times, worst of times” era—with challenges and opportunities unlike any of us have faced in at least a generation. At this time of apparent darkness all around us, it is our action now and in the very near future which will determine whether we emerge into a season of light, a spring of hope; whether the collective wisdom we share can be brought together such that movements of movements can emerge and collaborate to bring about a level and depth of global social change similarly unprecedented over the past century. Peace research pioneer Johan Galtung a dozen years ago wrote of the inevitable and forthcoming end of the empire known as the United States of America. Galtung predicted, like he successfully did more than a quarter-century earlier regarding the demise of the Soviet Union, that the US empire would give way—either in the direction of decentralized, democratic socialistic beloved communities or in a hyper-militarized fascism.

Anticipating, preparing for and resisting this direct and structural violence must be a hallmark of our work no matter what happens in the US electoral arena.'

Here in the US, what we are seeing national in both health care, education, and security/policing sectors federally and on every level is part and parcel of this trend. On-line schooling is thus depended upon from safety perspectives but also built upon as a current and future opportunity to further privatize, contain, and disempower all aspects of educational institutions and critical thinking. However, there is growing fightback. As a conclusion but also segue to our further discussions today, I am excited to report that the various coalitions which have emerged here in politically under-developed US, mostly led by Black liberation forces from the US South, are among the least sectarian, most diverse and robust we have experienced in many a year.

        text: 'It worth noting that this crisis period—not merely COVID-19 related, but of a neoliberal-neoconservative “convergence” of the past several years—has seen several critical initiatives which transcend old models of thinking and coalescing, beyond past failures of the left. The creation of the First Eco-socialist International not only built upon the theoretical approaches put forward by eco-feminist, indigenous, or environmentalist-Marxist options of the past, but put into dialogue the practitioners of grassroots alternatives from throughout the Global South. Thus over one hundred representatives from dozens of nations and peoples came together in the small African-centered communities of Veroes, Venezuela in 2017 to share practices of bartering, water-gathering, and organization.

It is clear that the World Social Forum, given both its strong past history and its continuing networking capabilities, has a role to play in this period. The extent and significance of that role will be directly proportional to WSF’s attention to these new movements and grassroots groupings which are themselves providing forum for a praxis which will shape the century.'
