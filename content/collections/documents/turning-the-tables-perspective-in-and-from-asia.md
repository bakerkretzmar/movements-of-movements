        text: 'First Industrial Revolution, and the rise of the European Capitalist Empires brought in its wake the celebration of body, suspicion of the soul and commodification of mind; relegating consciousness to pursuit of utilitarian ends through the narrowly carved path of ‘positive’ social sciences. Capitalist mind saw the planet and the universe as its mirror image, a body without a soul. Celebration of bodies triggered off a never-ending quest for colonization, possession, control, and consumption of land and natural habitat of pre capitalist communities, kingdoms and Empires in Asia. In the course of its rise and expansion during the next four centuries global capitalist empire has encountered moments of strife, conflict, chaos, disillusionment and finally it is coming closer to the moment of self annihilation. The Capitalist Order expanded by demolishing the organic relationships between the human communities, and the holistic relationship between the humans and nature; body and soul. It converted every manifestation of nature and every dimension of human activity into a commodity, into an object for drawing utilitarian pleasures. The underlying contradictions of this reductionist and utilitarian approach have brought us and our natural habitat to the brink of destruction.'

        text: "Asia responded to the capitalist order in diverse ways. Japan was the first to embrace capitalist science, technology and political norms in the nineteenth century and the first Asian power to defeat a European Empire in early twentieth century. The land of rising sun was the first Asian nation to became part of the glorious West. But it was not considered Western enough and at the end of second world war was subjected to a nuclear attack even after surrendering to the victors. The period between the First Industrial Revolution and the First World War was not only characterized by destruction of the pre capitalist order by the capitalist order but started what in the Asian context came to be called ‘The Great Game’\_between the European Empires – by then already including Russia\_- to lay claim to the biggest share of the global market. This led to armed rebellions in the colonies and the First World War."

        text: 'During the first and second world war period scrambling for colonial possessions escalated the conflict between European Empires and certain political forces in China and countries of South and South and East Asia resorted to armed insurrection against the British, French, Portuguese, Dutch and other European Empires. British successfully exterminated insurrections in Malaya and India by isolating and exterminating rebellious communities and infiltrating the ranks of insurgents but other European Empires that depended solely on brutal force and failed in defeating the insurgents or national wars of liberation. Two ‘great democratic states’ of India and Israel that tried to use the isolationist British strategy during the post World War II period against Kashmiris and Palestinians also failed. In British India insurrections and armed rebellions failed but nonviolence and constitutional struggle succeeded in ending the colonial rule. But without the sacrifices of Indian soldiers and millions of Bengali famine victims this political victory would not have been possible. Afghanistan was on the other end of the Spectrum. It is the only pre capitalist society which achieved the singular honor of defeating three European Empires setting feet on its soil- the British, the Russians and Americans. Colonies embraced capitalism during the struggle against the capitalist exploitation.'

        text: "End of the World War II led to the Cold War between the market and nonmarket economies for supremacy and control. This period saw unfolding of the second, third and fourth industrial revolutions, the establishment of an open Global Market, collapse of the nonmarket Empire and shift in the centre of global capital to China/India/Asia and threat to the very survival of the planet due to Climate Change. Asian economies are not only attracting global capital on mass scale but making headways in the global knowledge economy shaped by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The new game has not only set the old capitalist order led by the American Empire against the rising Asian capitalist order led by the emerging Chinese Empire but against the survival of the planet itself. \_"

        text: "During the past three centuries the capitalist empires demolished pre capitalist empires, reshaped the sphere of control of the colonial empires and defeated their nonmarket competitors. Capitalist Order overpowered all other orders. This time the capitalist order is under a life-threatening disorder. The choice is not between the capitalist and non capitalist orders but between the capitalist order and life on the planet. The world of nature insists on being befriended not consumed and converted into source of unlimited corporate profits. The world needs a post capitalist, post colonial order. Conventional wisdom does not help. Existing social science builds knowledge on the evidence found in the past. It is scientific in hindsight. It has relegated the task of delving into future to poets, dreamers, artists, magicians and sorcerers. The world in general and the world of Development Studies in particular needs a sorcerer; who is present but not visible to most of us. We need to start the search for the sorcerer. \_"
