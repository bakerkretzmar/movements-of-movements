        text: "At this juncture in world history, and in a world in tumult, we invite you to an exploratory workshop to initiate dialogue on emerging world politics and (dis)order, to be held at the University of Ottawa on November 5, 2019. \_Many of us - as teachers, as researchers, as students, as development practitioners, and as activists (and also in our various identities as women, men, and people of other sexualities, as Indigenous Peoples and as settlers, as people of different colours, faiths, ethnicities, and nationalities, and as Dalits and of other castes) - are already deeply concerned with aspects of these questions; but where it is perhaps true that we are all, in our own ways and at our own levels, struggling to cope with the swirling and spiralling chaos that has opened up all around us; almost in every sphere of life, and down to interpersonal relations. \_"

        text: "In this context of the spiralling rise of storms at a world scale, we are confronted with the stark choice between the survival of unregulated capitalism and empire and the survival of life on Mother Earth. \_The moment we are now in calls for revisiting assumptions, objectives, and laws governing the development and unfolding of the potentials of the global community, and our relationships with Mother Earth. \_Does this situation then also call for revisiting the content, focus, and scope of Development Studies and of International Development ? \_Specifically, what can Development Studies do as a discipline, and lens, to contribute to finding ways to address the emerging situation ? \_And how do the newly-resurgent sections that exist in all societies - such as Indigenous Peoples and Dalits - view this moment, and this subject ?\_ Do we all perhaps need to search – individually and collectively - for a new, decolonised, and more pluralist paradigm ?"
