However, as with many people of my generation in that industry, the path did not begin there. It started with actions of solidarity with struggles for self-determination, justice and peace in different parts of the world. In my case, the experience started with an immersion in the Philippines as a secondary school exchange student in 1974-75, during the early years of the now-infamous Marcos dictatorship.'

As time went by, having my roots in solidarity with movements for liberation and emancipation, I became more and more concerned with the way in which the world of international development institutions, and the aid industry in particular, was shaping the way we understood internationalism and solidarity.'

In 2002, when I attended the first Africa Social Forum in Bamako (leading up to the World Social Forum in Brazil), we in the international NGO world were lobbying for increases in aid as the primary response to poverty in the world. The Africa Social Forum brought together African activists from every region of the continent and from different sectors – youth, women, students, farmers, trade unionists, scholars, and trade, environment and peace activists — for a week of discussion and debate about what was needed for the peoples of the African continent. During that entire week, in formal presentations and informal discussions over meals and during breaks, while I was listening in order to learn what I could bring back to the advocacy work we were doing in Canada, I never heard anyone say, “Africa needs more international development assistance”.'

        text: 'Today, many of us in the movements to end mass deportation and mass incarceration do not want to simply resist those systems. We aim to end them and reimagine the meaning of justice in America. By the same token, many of those who are battling climate change and building movements for economic justice understand that merely tinkering with our political and economic systems will not end poverty or avert climate disaster, nor will mere resistance to the status quo. As the saying goes, “What you resist, persists.”'

Let us interrogate how we know what we know; what do we know of struggle, the crucible of reflection and practice? What kinds of knowledge do we have access to that can shelter hope by nourishing and supporting the struggles of those whose lives are devoted to survival and the invention of ways of being human?'

I am grateful to those who bring stories of social courage and invention to others so that we can be educated and inspired by those struggles, as directly and as authentically as possible. I am also strengthened by those who can tell me histories of struggle that have not yet penetrated the written accounts of the monocultures of euro-centric, and male-centric narratives of human history. These other narratives, these glimpses into the back alleys and behind the veils and curtains of the world are food for thought and soul.'
