This lived experience is what drives me to work on reconciliation, Indigenous land-related and resource extraction issues in the Canadian settler-colonial context.'

        text: 'First Nations, Inuit and Métis are distinct groups of Indigenous peoples in Canada with unique histories, languages, cultural practices, traditional territories and spiritual beliefs. Most Indigenous peoples share a relational worldview that emphasizes spirit & spirituality, meaning all things are living, and, in turn, a sense of community and respect for the ancestors, place and the ecology (Little Bear, 2000, p.77; Kovach, 2005; Louis, 2007). Relationships are the basis of who we are as a people and how we relate to the world.'

        text: 'Indigenous worldviews are generally associated with the circle, inter-dependent and connection to place based on respect, reciprocity, responsibility and relationship. Some Indigenous Nations in Canada also follow the 7 Grandfather Teachings (e.g., humility, bravery, honesty, wisdom, truth, respect and love) as part of their values, beliefs and practices. Moreover, there is a belief in the power of creating a shared mind with all of creation. This is best characterized as “power with”, as opposed to “power over” (Alberta Education 2005, p.18). In other words, humans are not considered superior to nature and all life is valued equally, holding a significant place in the world (Graham 2011). Lastly, knowledge is gained through the experience of living and interacting with nature in places and experiencing its local conditions. Our identity is drawn from relationships and the land.'

        text: 'The philosophical underpinning of Western worldviews is hierarchical rather than circular in nature. The “colonialist consciousness” (Grande 2015, p. 99) embodies hierarchical ideals of power residing at the top and considers man separate from and above land/nature (Graham 2011, p. 28 & 29). In other words, nature is a thing to possess. These differing understandings of relationality highlight the ongoing tension between settlers and Indigenous peoples.'

        text: "According to Grande (2015), the “colonialist consciousness” also relies on technological advancements as the way of solving all problems, which is linked to the idea of “progress as change and change as progress” (p. 99). There is also a belief that each person has a right to make their own personal choice (either/or thinking) as opposed to the notion of collectivism (p. 99).\_ Finally, scientists – including social scientists - see themselves see themselves as separate from nature; thus, nature becomes the object of study. Scientific thinking consists of analytical, materialist, objective and quantitative approaches grounded in academic writing and scientific experiments (p.99). This ideology separates spirituality from reasoning (p.99). For most people, this dominant perspective is what we know, live with and tend not to question."

        text: 'For Leroy Little Bear (2000), worldviews arise from a culture or a society’s shared philosophy, values and social customs. This perspective speaks directly to people’s interaction and inter-dependency with the land, the animals and the people surrounding them (Little Bear, 2000, p.77; Kovach, 2005; Louis, 2007). Nonetheless, Indigenous legal scholar Aaron Mills (2016) writes, “a worldview is not static, it “settles over time” (p. 852). Mills (2016), not unlike Little Bear, draws our attention to what he calls the Indigenous lifeworld. Indigenous lifeworlds consist of “a set of ontological, cosmological, and epistemological understandings which situate us in creation and thus which allow us to orient ourselves in all our relationships in a good way” (p. 852). Leroy Little Bear, Aaron Mills and other Indigenous scholars all point to the significance of engaging with the very real plurality of Indigenous ways of knowing, being and doing within local, national and global world systems.'

        text: 'Ramon Grosfoguel (2016), a decolonial scholar, sees the potentiality of pluri-versality wherein one can live in a world where many worlds are possible. The idea of pluri-versality is grounded in the inter-connectedness of cosmologies (Mignolo 2013). This pluri-versal world necessitates inter-cultural dialogue across “diverse critical epistemic/ethical/political projects” (Grosfoguel 2008, p.1). On the other hand, Laura Perez, a Chicana feminist scholar, brings the idea of “decolonial love” into the conversation as a means of re-centering the sacred within humanity (Craun 2013). '

        text: 'In the Mayan culture, for example, the principle of In’Laketch suggests humans are vibrant beings deeply connected with a universal vibration, implying that we are all related as humans (Craun 2013). The idea of relationality is also central in Mills and Little Bear’s interpretations of worldviews and lifeworlds. Thus, it appears that spiritual traditions and love can play a role in building a better global understanding of humanity, one that offers a decolonial move away from solely relying upon Western modes of thinking and being in the world.'

        text: ' historical complicity and contemporary failure to address colonial difference, Indigenous epistemic and social locations were excluded within the modern nation-state and world-system. According to Indigenous scholar Willie Ermine (2007), the work-around is to co-create knowledge and change that results in partners dialoguing across differences as equals (p. 201 & 202). In simple terms, ethical space advances inter-cultural dialogue and the co-creation of both knowledge and change. Ermine (2007) argues in favour of the need to collaboratively assess colonial structures and processes as a way of assisting in the cross-cultural identification of ethical, moral and legal principles (p. 201 & 202; Ermine et al. 2005, p. 7).'

Therefore, the inclusion of Indigenous voices and worldviews is necessary to achieve genuine reconciliation and to effect structural and people reform that addresses the deep inequality, oppression, and racism experienced by Indigenous sub-alterns across the world. Creation of an ethical space serves to problematize settler-colonial liberal-capitalist democracy’s notion of only “one-right way” (Grosfoguel 2016).'

        text: ' Decolonial scholarship does not clearly espouse a theory of reconciliation; however, I have interpreted pluri-versality as a potential pathway for achieving genuine reconciliation. Pluri-versality encourages the co-existence of other cosmologies and epistemologies at the local and global levels. Nth-eyed seeing of this nature creates space for different worldviews to produce more comprehensive solutions. Acceptance of diverse worldviews as opposed to dominant settler-colonial liberal-capitalist democracy’s epistemologies, cosmologies and claims of modernity and capitalism is critical to realizing genuine reconciliation (Grosfoguel 2016).'

        text: " For the purpose of this short paper, settler-colonialism and liberal democracy are considered inseparable. Therefore, I refer to this embeddedness as settler-colonial liberal-capitalist democracy. It is significant to note that the concept maintains a strong focus on political economy, which is directly tied to capitalism and labour. That said, liberalism whether classical, laissez-faire and/or semi-representative takes the form of a centralized nation-state that upholds personal autonomy, reasonableness and a liberal society of “like-minded individuals” (Brown 2014, p.1; Hueglin 1994, p. 10). Citizens under this ideological pretext experience “freedom and equality of opportunity” in the form of nation-state control over their living conditions (Hueglin 1994, p. 9 & 10). This means citizens are required to accept a certain level of compromise and subservience to the nation-state (Hueglin 1994, p. 9 & 10). Conversely, some individuals and/or groups experience liberalism not only as “oppressive standardization and conformity’, but also as a form of “peripheral subordination to, and exploitation by, centrally dominant elites” (Hueglin 1994, p.10). Canadian semi-representative liberalism is described by some scholars as “democratic, elite-protecting and rights-based elements and institutions” (Vance 2016, p.1). The latter form of liberalism creates situations of over-and under-representation amongst different group interests, resulting in conflicts over “power and resources” under the pretence of a “general national interest” (Vance 2016, p. 1). \_Moreover, distinctions are evident between those nation-states adhering to the principle of popular sovereignty and Canadian state formation which support the larger goal of “peace, order and good government” in s.91 of the "

        text: '. The latter emphasizes the protection of the private property rights regime (Vance 2016, p.1). From the lens of semi-representative liberalism, Canadian nation-state formation is cast as an elitist framework that controls the will of the people and protects the interests of the elite (Vance 2016, p.1). This interpretation demonstrates the importance of giving Indigenous political orders a greater voice in a new multi-government arrangement. After all, the original peoples of Canada did not have a say in early nation-state formation, and it was not until 1960 when registered Indians were actually permitted to vote and have their voices heard in Canadian elections.'
