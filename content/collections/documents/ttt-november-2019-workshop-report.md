        text: 'We are at a critical juncture at this moment in time, facing a growing disillusionment among different sections of the public in countries around the world, both in the South and the North, with the current neoliberal economic and political order that has dominated the world for quite some time. Growing concerns about climate change, rising income inequality, polarization, populist nationalism, and unending military conflicts are a direct consequence of this economic and political order that was historically erected by colonial empires and maintained through the ‘great games’ that the empires played to promote their economic interests and to attempt to maintain their global hegemonies. The ‘development project’ of more recent times is also seen by many as part of these games that empires have historically played to convert subsistent economies into market economies through Official Development Assistance, technical guidance, and institutional development. In this context, ‘development’ as it is known and experienced is now being questioned and contested.'

        text: 'Parallel to this disenchantment with neoliberal capitalism has been the rise of new economic powers such as China and Russia (the latter, post the collapse of the Soviet Union) that are challenging the hegemony of the North while the North itself is turning inwards confounded by its own internal divisions. The information and communication revolutions and the rise of social media have added to the growing chaos while also contributing positively by enabling other actors to challenge the status quo, initiating powerful democratizing movements across the world, empowering the rise of feminism, and increasing the outreach of civil society in stoking the consciousness of the general populace on various issues including climate change.'

        text: 'In this context of this rising turbulence and chaos, we are at the crossroads of history, facing a stark choice between the survival of unregulated capitalism through the empire and the survival of life on Earth. It is time to question the idea of development and to revisit the content, focus, and scope of international development. The time is also ripe to search for a new decolonised and a more pluralist development paradigm. The purpose of this Workshop was to create space for scholars, development practitioners, thinkers, and students to share their thoughts through an open, critical, and cross-sectoral engagement and to facilitate the creation of networks for collaboration on research-related initiatives.'

While providing a context to the event, Jai informed the audience that the major objective of this workshop was to open space for the exchange of ideas and perspectives on the changing sphere of the world and the chaos that so widely seems to characterise this turbulent period.'

Although both the British and Russian empires subsequently collapsed, a new empire led by the US emerged and has played its games. This empire is in turn now being dismantled and replaced by other emerging empires including those of China, India, Brazil etc. These empires and the great games they play in their competition with each, contribute – among many other things - to the phenomenon that we now refer to as climate change. What makes this era important and interesting is that the Mother Nature is now an actor and a force to reckon with.'

This relational worldview stands in stark contrast to the western worldview that is inspired by what Indigenous scholar Sande Grande calls the ‘colonialist consciousness’ and is based on hierarchical ideals of power whereby men reside at the top and nature is a thing to possess. \_"

While providing a snapshot of her journey into the field of development studies, Molly shared how her experiences led her to question international development institutions, especially the aid industry, in defining the common understanding of social solidarity. She related her experience working with the African Social Forum in Bamako and listening to Indigenous social activist groups from all walks of life and regions in Africa. Noone in these deliberations mentioned that Africa needed more aid. This observation was directly in conflict with Canada’s international development strategy at that time which was primarily centered on increasing aid to reduce poverty. This led Molly to delve deeper into the political economy of aid and the assumptions underlying the notion of aid as a panacea for development.'

        text: 'Molly emphasized that development project itself is historically contested in that it is Eurocentric, based on white supremacy, and aimed at increasing corporate profits in the North. This development project inspired by neoliberalism and capitalism led to the structural adjustment programs in the South and austerity in the North. The logic of aid in this development thinking was that we can generate a surplus out of the system that is impoverishing people and damaging the environment and with that surplus, we can fix the damage. This thinking measures international solidarity and care by the amount of aid, and it deals with the crisis of capital and not with the crisis of human beings that is created in the process of increasing commodification of societal relationships and the development process. This is the logic that we have a difficult time challenging, Molly emphasized. This logic talks about ‘poverty’ and not impoverishment, and it translates solidarity into a ‘white savior complex’ that reinforces white supremacy and racism into the development project. It is based on capitalism where growth is considered synonymous with corporate profit, and any challenge to this logic is dismissed as unrealistic.'

To break the circle of capitalism, we need to let go off the logic of capitalism and the need to be correct in our conclusions. Peace will not be profitable but it will be peace, justice will not be profitable but it will be justice. We need to risk the uncertain territory of imperfect but real social invention. Let us be bold to let go off the logic that insists that we need to build pipelines to finance clean energy and that we need to tax war to build peace.'

Capitalism and the system that we live in limits our imagination and that recognition is important to liberate our imagination. We need to embrace realism and recognize that no single leader or ideology will deliver us. Perhaps what we need more of today is ‘Feral Politics’ which is the politics of defending the best possible future for humanity. '

Participants themselves chose which group they would join, and the groups that formed then spent around 40-60 minutes on group discussion. Resource persons for each group shared the key points of the group discussion in the second plenary that started at 3:00 pm.'

This suggests a hollow conception of reconciliation in which the state’s sovereignty superseded Aboriginal title. The politics of recognition advances reconciliation through a ‘sovereign subject’ perspective based on the use of human-to-human agreements (e.g., economic development, treaties, and other constructive arrangements), whereas Indigenous Peoples look at reconciliation from a relational perspective where inherent rights flow from the creator and not government laws. To describe this tension between the two approaches, Carolyn divided her presentation into four parts:'

        text: ' According to Maximilian Forte, there are three possible answers: first, the term ‘Indian’ can mean a state of being in the world. Second, it can be understood as a noble and stable being; and finally, according to Forte’s perspective, Indian identity can be understood through a number which is used to track them in a way that no one else is tracked. Indigenous community still grapples with the idea of blood quantum. Carolyn related the experience of her own daughter who has mixed ancestry. In some Mohawk communities, this is problematic because once an Indigenous member marries out of the community, he/she must stay out of the community. Indigenous identity in Canada has strong political undercurrents. The internalization of colonialism by some Indigenous Peoples has resulted in confusion at the community level around the notion of Indigeneity.'

        text: 'Reconciliation typology, based on Carolyn’s research work, is synthesized into four distinct types: genuine, stand-alone, transitional, and assimilative. Her findings indicate that ‘reconciliation’ is a contested term. Genuine reconciliation involves intercultural, legal, political, and epistemological change. It deconstructs structural cultural dichotomy. It engages in relational responsibility and dialogue, and it values other worldviews. If the federal government wants to move away from the rights recognition model of reconciliation, it needs to think and act differently in its approach to indigeneity in Canada. It needs to embrace the idea of coexistence and pluri-versality. Based on her research, Carolyn has found that we are still in a dominant mode of being and knowing in a country that continues to suppress Indigenous life modes.'

To conclude, these findings indicate \_that Canada is imperialist in nature and the victims are the Indigenous People. The reconciliation project inspired by liberalism aims to protect capital and labor. Nonetheless, the evidence demonstrates that the Liberal world view should not embed Indigenous worldviews because of differentiated philosophical origins, and any attempt to do so would not bring any deep structural reform in government-Indigenous relations, Carolyn emphasized."

Most indigenous languages do not contain the word of reconciliation as such but do contain a variety of words that describe the notion of reconciliation.

It is only when there is an economic development project that the conflict and tension between the western and Indigenous lifeworlds becomes more obvious. Due to the lack of ethical space, unfortunately the relationship never reaches one of a true partnership.'

We need to rethink the gamut of International Development and harness the potential of researchers in this area, Nadia said. The pedagogy and style of teaching also needs improvement: more than half of the courses at international development are taught by faculty members who have no employment security. Quite regrettably, the federal government has been contributing to this worsening trend. At present, we do not have the pedagogical resources to devise strategies that move beyond scantrons to evaluate students. Nadia concluded with a hopeful note that despite these challenges, there are ways through which we can reform the system through conscious thinking.'

The ideal political system according to this notion is based on sovereignty of states with political borders and an economic system - essentially capitalistic in nature – that generates positive economic growth.

Rahman emphasized two key points: First, the current global hegemonic system - that is in a state of crisis at the moment - is the victim of processes it has created. like the liberalization and globalization of international trade. The emergence of competing powers like China, India, and Brazil are the outcomes of this system that were created by the North to maintain its global hegemony. The Bretton Woods institutions, created after World War II, extended the pre-war colonialism on the notion of western superiority in managing global order. The U.S led the process of hegemonic order.

Sajjadur also compared the North and the South’s style of funding. The South’s style is more transactional in nature where, for instance, an infrastructure project is promised on the basis of access to land for growing crops. This is different from the type of conditionalities that North demanded compliance with - in terms of governance, gender equality, and human rights - in exchange for foreign aid.'

It is the region with some of the most advanced historical civilizations. It was the first to be colonized by the Europeans. It is the region with great racial diversity resulting in tumultuous politics in terms of legacies of racism and colonialism.

A few takeaways from this workshop that personally stimulated Rika included the difference between the colonial and indigenous perspectives on land and the idea that land and how we associate ourselves with land and territory was a social construct. Also, the lived experiences and how they contrast with the institutional standards of knowledge inspired her. The diversity and heterogeneity of regions and the people living in those regions is also crucial to know for an in-depth understanding of international development.'

In terms of international aid, Rika learned many new ideas especially the fact that aid continues to exert its role in international development with different actors and hierarchical relationships.'

Regarding the educational reforms and pedagogy in international development, Rika agreed that students learn better if they can visualize what they are learning and apply their knowledge to careers that are sustainable. She felt that the evaluation of the knowledge through multiple choice exams that are graded by a scantron machine definitely has limited scope to achieve the kind of learning outcomes that Rika thinks would land students in sustainable careers in international development.'

Some Indigenous Nations in Canada also follow the 7 Grandfather Teachings (e.g., humility, bravery, honesty, wisdom, truth, respect and love) as part of their values, beliefs and practices. Moreover, there is a belief in the power of creating a shared mind with all of creation. This is best characterized as “power with”, as opposed to “power over” (Alberta Education 2005, p.18). In other words, humans are not considered superior to nature and all life is valued equally, holding a significant place in the world (Graham 2011). Lastly, knowledge is gained through the experience of living and interacting with nature in places and experiencing its local conditions. Our identity is drawn from relationships and the land.'

There is also a belief that each person has a right to make their own personal choice (either/or thinking) as opposed to the notion of collectivism (p. 99).\_ Finally, scientists – including social scientists - see themselves see themselves as separate from nature; thus, nature becomes the object of study. Scientific thinking consists of analytical, materialist, objective and quantitative approaches grounded in academic writing and scientific experiments (p.99). This ideology separates spirituality from reasoning (p.99). For most people, this dominant perspective is what we know, live with and tend not to question."

Engagés dans une course effrénée au «\_développement\_», mus par le désir d’être Leader parmi les Nations et aveuglés par l’avoir, tous les pays, surtout ceux dits développés restèrent sourds à cette alerte relative au danger planétaire. Aussi, ni le Rapport Brundtland, \"La Planète, Notre avenir à tous\" en 1985, ni les divers rapports du GIEC, ni l’Accord de Paris de 2015, n’ont engendré des changements durables. Aujourd’hui, ouragans, feux de forêts, inondations, canicules, etc., frappent de partout les humains et créent souffrances et des morts, surtout dans des zones vulnérables telles que l’Afrique Sahélienne en proie à la sécheresse et à la désertification.

C’est le cas pour les Autochtones d’Australie et d’Amérique dont une bonne partie fut exterminée, des Acadiens, qui subirent une déportation massive, des Juifs qui furent victimes des horreurs de l’Holocauste, des gens du Moyen Orient pour s’accaparer de leur pétrole. Force est de noter aussi que les Palestinien-e-s sont en train de payer depuis plus de 7 décennies (1947-2019) le prix d’une faute qu’ils n’ont pas commise, à savoir la Shoah ou l’holocauste juif.

Pour justifier leur ignominie, ces oppresseurs secrètent aussi une idéologie raciste sur les Peuples dominés. Elles constituent des armes à destruction massive de l’Humanité.

Capitalist mind saw the planet and the universe as its mirror image, a body without a soul. Celebration of bodies triggered off a never-ending quest for colonization, possession, control, and consumption of land and natural habitat of pre capitalist communities, kingdoms and Empires in Asia. In the course of its rise and expansion during the next four centuries global capitalist empire has encountered moments of strife, conflict, chaos, disillusionment and finally it is coming closer to the moment of self-annihilation. The Capitalist Order expanded by demolishing the organic relationships between the human communities, and the holistic relationship between the humans and nature; body and soul. It converted every manifestation of nature and every dimension of human activity into a commodity, into an object for drawing utilitarian pleasures. The underlying contradictions of this reductionist and utilitarian approach have brought us and our natural habitat to the brink of destruction.'

But it was not considered Western enough and at the end of second world war was subjected to a nuclear attack even after surrendering to the victors. The period between the First Industrial Revolution and the First World War was not only characterized by destruction of the pre capitalist order by the capitalist order but started what in the Asian context came to be called ‘The Great Game’\_between the European Empires – by then already including Russia\_- to lay claim to the biggest share of the global market.

Two ‘great democratic states’ of India and Israel that tried to use the isolationist British strategy during the post World War II period against Kashmiris and Palestinians also failed. In British India insurrections and armed rebellions failed but nonviolence and constitutional struggle succeeded in ending the colonial rule. But without the sacrifices of Indian soldiers and millions of Bengali famine victims this political victory would not have been possible. Afghanistan was on the other end of the Spectrum. It is the only pre capitalist society which achieved the singular honor of defeating three European Empires setting feet on its soil- the British, the Russians and Americans.

These mechanisms sparked the economic rise of the South and the emergence of competing regional powers like China, India and Brazil. The developing world is now more “middle-income” (107 countries in 2019) than “low-income” (31) and their development aspirations are more nationally driven than dictated from the outside. For example, the SDGs, are used more as indicators rather than as primary goals (as was the case for MDGs) in many planning frameworks.

        text: 'It is unclear what global construct will emerge out of the current chaos. One important conundrum is how to balance hyper-globalization with the need for international codes of conduct. The answer is not immediately evident, and the vacuum is currently filled by the dictum of the global market mechanisms.

        text: "This is a Discussion Note for an exploratory workshop to initiate dialogue on emerging world politics and (dis)order, to be held at the University of Ottawa on November 5 2019.\_ Many of us - as teachers, as researchers, as students, as development practitioners, as activists, and as normal people in our everyday lives (and also in our various identities as women, men, and people of other sexualities, as Indigenous Peoples and as settlers, as people of different colours, faiths, ethnicities, and nationalities, and as Dalits and of other castes) - are already concerned with aspects of these questions; and where it is perhaps also true that we are all, in our own ways and at our own levels, struggling to cope with the swirling and spiralling chaos that has opened up all around us; almost in every sphere of life, and down to interpersonal relations, in our workplaces and in our homes.\_ Our objective is to create a space for open, critical, and cross-sectoral engagement with the big picture in our times, and for all of us to look beyond our own horizons; and where we are hopeful that this first workshop may trigger participants to taking related initiatives, perhaps even on a networked basis.\_ Given the stage that they are in their lives, we are very hopeful that this event might especially be of interest to students and to younger people, and where we are attempting to design it accordingly."

        text: "This ‘global market’ has however brought out into the open divisions and tensions of a different kind. \_It has brought to centre stage the conflict between the materialist, utilitarian, and instrumental outlook that is the foundational characteristic of contemporary politics and economics, and a respect (and reverence) for Mother Earth and Earth Spiritualism that cultures around the world share.\_ It has led to a massive intensification of climate change, to a deepening and widening of income inequalities not only in the South but also in the developed economies in the North, and to unending military conflicts; and where each of these has had (and is continuing to have) multiple outfalls, and many of which are intersecting.\_ It has also contributed to the rise of fundamentalist and populist movements and politicians within societies both in the South and the North, taking advantage of the intensifying precarity and resentment that ordinary people all over the world are today experiencing as a consequence of the emergence of a single global market and framework, and that are increasingly expressing themselves as intensifying xenophobia, religious communalisms, and virulent, populist nationalisms.\_ Witness South Africa, the US, and increasingly, now also countries in Europe.\_ So-called ‘neoliberal globalisation’ has come home to roost, and this tendency is now in turn profoundly challenging the ‘internationalism’ and ‘multilateralism’ that was till very recently seen as the face – and the foundation - of the new world.\_"

Even if ‘wrong’, this nomenclature stuck, and came to be widely used within the colonised countries and by colonial administrations (such as the ‘Indian Act’ in Canada), and including as a self-descriptor by Indigenous Peoples themselves (for instance, by AIM, the American Indian Movement – see "
