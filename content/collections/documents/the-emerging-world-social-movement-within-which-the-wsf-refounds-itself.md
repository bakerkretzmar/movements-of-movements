The pandemia have unleashed a development within all main people''s movement during some decades to address not only its own main issues but also relate to issues of concern for other movements. The kind of nuanced way to develop both a multi issue resistance and alternatives often attributed to spaces like WSF or the exchange of experience between movements have now occurred within each movement.'

It comes in a time when the movements are weak apart from several temporarily outburst of protests mainly on national level the last ten years with peaks in the beginning of the decade and at the end. At the same time corporate power, privatization and austerity politics seems stronger than ever penetrating every aspect of life including the way movements and political parties communicate more and more in the interest of US based digital platforms.'

Two concerns issues and another form. We have the tension span between movements focusing in one end social issues and in the other end ecological issues. Another content span is between focusing on resistance here and now and in the other end so called prefigurative struggles or building of alternatives. When it comes to form we have the span between open space and representative forms of uniting a movement or alliances.'

It can also be seen in terms class base were those focusing on social issues are more urban and industrial focused with development as a key concept and trade unions as one of their main pillars of attraction. Those focusing on ecological issues have often a more rural and agricultural, forestry and other rural economy focus with civilizational critique as a key concept and small farmer and similar movements as their main pillar of attraction. It is no coincidence that the only main people''s movmemnts mentioning indigenous peoples in the Covid-19 cirisis statement is Friends of the Earth International and campaign Demand Climate Justice.

Organizations addressing social issues as a form of charity or bureaucratic trrade unions seeing a movement among workers more as a threat than than a strength for the working class. Or organizations addressing environmental issues as piecemeal questions for technical and other changes within the system or farmers organizations adjusting themselves to the agroindustry and financial interests.'

The use of the term globalism is such an issue. While the mass movements in the South as well as system critical ecological movements in the North never changed its antiglobalization identity or never took to its heart the alterglobalization concept many on the left and the social forum process made this concept central to their concerns.

        text: 'Personally as an environmentalist and identifying myself with concepts supported by the mass movements in the global South and rural movements in the North I protested against the shift from antiglobalization to alterglobalisation. In Sweden it was carried out by the Anarchosyndicalist weekly soon followed by Attac and man others that saw in the WSF open space formula a way forward for peoples movements. The problem with the shift was its idiosyncracy showing the lack of interest in biological realities among the left. The material reality in the globalization concept is the claim that there is an ongoing compression of time and space in the world. Such a compression of biology or what we also can call ecosystems and relationships in the biosphere and atmosphere is an ecological catastrophe. This has been clearly exposed by the Covid-19 pandemia as this globalization of biology caused by agroindustry, industrial forestry etc creates more and more zoonotic virus in one end and health problem in the other.

        text: "The left in the North and their close cooperation partners in the South created instead their own globalization concept devoid of its material content with a focus only on the social side. Terms as globalization from below came into fashion and the less problematic concepts as internationalism for cooperation across all borders were replaced by a vision of alternative globalization and not alternative to globalization. A simplistic notion showing the disinterest among the left for biological realties. This conflict spelled out in the European Social Forum which was used by the left for their social and sometimes pro EU agenda thus never replacing the invalid WSF declaration at the official\_ESF website with the first version from April 2001 were only social conflicts are made central as capitalism and imperialism while the second since valid\_declaration from June 2001 putting equal emphasis on social and ecological concerns was dismissed while environmental movements were treated as junior partners."

At the moment one can see this expressed in initiatives like the Tapestry of alternatives, Transition Towns and many similar efforts are popular together with so called ”Coalitions of the Willing” bringing together urban municipalities that wants to go further on social and often climate issues, quite often with a blurred relationship to entrepreneurship and cooperation with companies while at other times far more radical than any movement focusing on large scale resistance.

Avaaz is a US based net campaigning\_platform\_claiming t have\_more than 50 million members world\_wide. The concept member used here lacks democratic rights to influence the decision-making\_of the organization. The content have also a tendency to slide from opposing\_wars in the 00s to promoting\_wars in the 10s with humanitarian\_arguments. There is in general a lack of a comprehensive\_system critical way of addressing issues. This is understandable as anyone can make their own appeal for something with the help of Avaaz, a sort of perfect open space. You are then claimed\_to be a member of Avaaz and used\_as a legitimation of the organization. You also receive the selected\_campaigning actions by the unaccountable leadership of the organisation.\_"

        text: "Empirical evidence and exchange of experience seems of less interest among some of the main opponents in the debate. If such evidence is brought up by proponents of open space it is the problems that was caused by vertical decision making and factionalism among the Left in a state centric system. The experience of the ecological and other non-leftists movements that are not state centric are excluded as a point of reference. These movements have used different combinations of horizontal and vertical or representative forms of decision-making and discussion long before the Left believes they invented the wheel with the open space formula and WSF. Already in 1972 such multiissue alternative forums were held during the first UN conference on environment dealing with issues as war, development, urbanization and depopulation of the countryside, indigenous way of alternatives to the present world order, and working conditions in daily\_life, the last a social issue seldom seen at social forums. The fact that the Norwegian Social Forum was established in 1999 before WSF shows that the claim of being unique is not valid. "

Both seems to believe that changing WSF or keeping it as it is is the key to come forward for the emerging peoples movement capable of addressing the socio-ecological crisis. This can be questioned from empirical and theoretical points of view. '

There has been long before WSF and since it started direct connections between movements and as expressed recently in relation to the Covid-19 pandemia also learning processes within a movement making it able to integrate several issues in a comprehensive way. It is generally accepted that the climate justice movement, Fridays for Future and extinction Rebellion have developed outside the social forum process. This is even more the case with the movement for food sovereignty started in Nyeleni i Mali 2007 by La Via Campesina in close cooperation with friends of the Earth and others. It was also expressed at the 125 year anniversary of the International Peace Bureau in 2016 when the chair of InternationalTrade Union Confederation ITUC and Friends of the Earth International was invited to speak about climate justice transition.

This lack has partly been due to the systematic erasing of the memory of how such movements can change history from public discourse. This situation has not been helped by intellectuals having more interest\_in discussing WSF than actual movements. How the goals of WSF actually is carried out by peoples movement outside the social forum process or in some cases as an opposition to the open space formula that have dominated and crippled many social forums have seldom been of interest.
