If what D’Souza says is true, then Canada’s entire approach to reconciliation through the “recognition of rights, respect, co-operation, and partnership” (Government of Canada, 2015) with Indigenous peoples may hold nothing more than empty promises.'

This calls attention to dominant conceptions of land and rights needing to reconcile capitalist economic development with Indigenous relationality, inherent rights, sovereignty and legal traditions. I argue that a settler-colonial liberal-capitalist democracy model of reconciliation is a hollow proposition since it subordinates Indigenous sovereignty, inherent rights, and relationality under the thumb of exploitative national and global capitalist markets. Moreover, it coerces and subjects First Nations to the logic of capitalist forces for the sole purpose of opening Indigenous lands to the market instead of supporting Indigenous peoples’ social reproduction (Jobin & Riddle 2019, p. 15; Castros-Rea, J. & Altamirano-Jiménez, I. 2008). The following research questions will guide this paper: First, what is the present state of Indigeneity and Indigenous rights in Canada? Second, how can reconciliation make possible transnational pluri-versality in Canada? Third, what must Canada do to look out to the world stage from an Indigenous worldview?'

        text: 'Tlakatekatl (2014), a Chicano activist and scholar, for example, poses the million-dollar question, what is Indigeneity? He boldly asks us to consider: “…Who defines it; a government, a group of people, an authoritative individual?” He raises the issue of how difficult it is to apply the term Indigeneity given the “long settler-colonial legacy of denying indigenous people their Native ethnicity in North America…” (Tlakatekatl 2014). Whereas anthropologist Maximillian Forte (2013) asks us to think about, who is an Indian? For Forte there are three possible answers. First, the term Indian can mean a state of “being” in the world. Second, it can be understood as a knowable and stable category. And, finally, Indigeneity, from his perspective, is something that can be quantified through “a head count” (p.6). Regardless, the responses emphasize the value that settler-colonialism places on validating or disqualifying an individual’s claim to Indigeneity. The Canadian settler-colonial liberal-capitalist democracy construct therefore uses race to control and/or make Indigeneity visible.'

He argues that “gender, culture, nationhood and tradition” (p.20) requires constant contestation in which he uses a gendered analysis to problematize the “affirmative relationship between recognition and freedom” (p.20). Jace Weaver (2005), on the other hand, stresses post-colonial theory’s opposition to the existence of any “real essence in a given racial/ethnic category or identity” (p. 227). If this isn’t already complicated enough, CookLynn writes that Indigenous peoples use essentialism to counter-act domination and create space for their voices to be heard (cited in Weaver 2005, p. 227).'

        text: "The bureaucratic and political buzz on reconciliation has produced a multitude of reactions. At the individual level, public servants continue to grapple with what reconciliation means and how to put it into practice. Political messaging and actions to date have provoked a range of First Nation reactions on the reconciliation agenda. Nonetheless, there is much disparity in the views amongst federal and Indigenous governments on how best to reconcile land and rights issues. Some First Nations agree with the state rights-recognition wherein the relationship is one of “…a renewed legal and political relationship of rights recognition” (Coulthard 2014, p.3) in which resources and rights are redistributed through constructive arrangements. This view of reconciliation, Coulthard argues, assimilates Indigenous polities into Canadian society and merely reproduces configurations of colonial power instead of “peaceful co-existence grounded in the ideal of mutuality” (Coulthard 2013, p.2). Whereas other First Nations maintain the Indigenous lifeworld \_is the only possible framework. Those adopting this viewpoint choose not to engage with state contructs for achieving reconciliation. They claim that Indigenous inherent rights, their laws and their jurisdiction do not require state recognition or approval. In this context, Indigenous people actively maintain a “sustainable relationship with the land” (Coulthard 2014, p. 158; Alfred 2005, p. 40 - 45). Lastly, other First Nations believe reconciliation can be achieved by using a hybrid model of the two approaches. Interestingly, Ovide Mercredi had a similar experience of dealing with differing traditions and a divide amongst First Nationss on self-government."

Communities expressed relative unease with the process and timelines for overhauling the suite of land policies. Moreover, the perception that government was “continuing its old ways“ created issues of trust (Brake 2019). More generally, Indigenous peoples felt that governmental efforts were threatening Indigenous self-determination and inherent rights and jurisdictions. Beaver First Nation Chief Trevor Mercredi observed: “The government has taken away the authority of the people, the true rights holders in Canada…They’re domesticating everything we own, they’re domesticating us as each day goes by” (Blake 2019). As a result of this debacle, Indigenous leaders and community members have become even less tolerant of government‘s “colonial shape-shifting“ (Alfred & Corntassel 2005) tactics. Rather, there is a strong desire for deep institutional change by government in advancing and achieving reconciliation. The failure to secure First Nation support shows there is resistance to complete subordination of the Indigenous lifeworld under that of settler-colonial liberal-capitalist democracy. First Nations desire a nation-to-nation partnership that results in the co-design and co-development of land policy reforms. \_\_"

        text: 'From the Indigenous lens, the experience of inter-state relations takes the form of “violence, broken treaties and other unjust assertions of power over Indigenous peoples and their lands” (Corntassel & Woons 2018). First Nations regularly resist the present political relationship. Instead, they seek political and legal relationships wherein their lifeworld and ideas of self-determination are valued over the “Westphalian idea of state sovereignty” (Corntassel & Woons 2018). Taiaiake Alfred (2005) and Leanne Simpson (2011) argue that some First Nations turn away from the “legacies of colonialism” (p.19). Reconciliation in this sense means a return to Indigenous political and legal autonomy based on cultural “resurgence”'

In other words, their claim reinforces First Nation primacy of the Indigenous lifeworld in national and international relations. \_Corntassel & Woons (2018) believe it is possible to “share power” at the nation-state and global system levels by “reinvigorating treaties with the natural world, (re)establishing alliances between Indigenous peoples and/or Indigenous advocacy in diplomatic activities within global forums”. This proposition promotes increased opportunity for engaging with pluri-versality and genuine reconciliation at the international realm."

        text: ' drives settler-colonial liberal-capitalist democracy’s “productive character of colonial power... and coercive authority…” (p. 152). Todd Gordon (2010b) is highly critical of Canadian imperalist efforts that rob Indigenous peoples of their natural resources, wealth, land and rights through treaty-making, exploitation or theft as a function of “accumulation by dispossession” (Harvey, 2006; p. 68-69). Gordon (2010b) implies that primitive accumulation results in the acceleration of capitalist exploitation to the detriment of Indigenous peoples. As described, the government’s legal and political interventions continue to constrain Indigenous sovereignty. In other words, imperialist tools control Indigenous peoples and their land. Although the promise of jobs and resource development are essential tools for lifting Indigenous peoples out of poverty, Coulthard (2013) observes that: “colonial powers will only recognize the collective rights and identities of Indigenous peoples insofar as this recognition does not obstruct the imperatives of state and capital” (p. 8). This signals the impossibility of ever achieving “sovereignty at par” between Indigenous political orders and those of federal and provincial governments. First Nations resist imperialist efforts despite the imposition of domestic treaty arrangements and/or international treaty agreements. Considering the Canadian imperialist agenda, I argue the settler-colonial liberal-capitalist democracy is privileged over the Indigenous lifeworld. Therefore, it appears that Canada’s imperialist strategies and tactics incur negative consequences for Indigenous peoples and do not result in genuine reconciliation.'

        text: "Genuine reconciliation is the only viable alternative to the settler-colonial liberal-capitalist democracy ideology and its imperialistic tendencies. By recognizing pluri-versality locally, trans-nationally and globally, Indigenous lifeworlds are respected. Reconciliation under this guise emphasizes co-existence and emancipation as the tools for acting upon Indigenous worldviews, laws, epistemologies, self-determination and Indigenous rights at the national and global-levels.\_ It includes: the possibility of co-creating knowledge and the joint construction of a new moral, political and legal order. Moreover, reconciliation of multiple distinct worldviews/lifeworlds can transform settler-colonial liberal-capitalist democratic institutions and relationship-building processes in a way that: balances power, bridges the racial divide, and emphasizes Indigenous humanity, social relations, land, and political and legal agency over wealth creation. Genuine reconciliation can also decolonize the ongoing contradiction between wealth creation and cultural value to improve power-sharing and joint problem-solving locally, nationally and globally."

This speaks directly to people’s interaction and inter-dependency with the land, the animals and the people surrounding them (Little Bear, 2000, p.77; Kovach, 2005; Louis, 2007)). There is a multiplicity of Indigenous worldviews with some over-arching commonalities, however, the belief and value systems can and do differ somewhat because each nation’s place of origin is different. A worldview is not static, it “settles over time” (Mills, 2016, p. 852).'

        text: ' Glen Coulthard’s understanding of recognition is based on Richard J. F. Day’ work. He interprets the politics of recognition as “recognition-based models…reconciling Indigenous assertions of nationhood with settler-state sovereignty via the accommodation of Indigenous identity claims in…a renewed legal and political relationship…” (Coulthard, 2014, p.3; Day, 2000). It is the present political mode by which the Crown asserts sovereignty over Indigenous peoples and their lands. Coulthard (2014) also draws extensively upon Fanon’s work to critique the Hegel’s liberalized approach to the relationship between recognition and freedom arising from the master/slave dialectic (p.16). According to Coulthard (2014), Hegellian views of recognition and freedom subject the colonized to “practices and subject positions” (p.16). Coulthard claims Hegel’s view differs from the Fanonian argument that liberal forms of recognition and freedom reinforce the reproduction and maintenance of colonial relations (p.17).'

        text: " For the purpose of this short paper, settler-colonialism and liberal democracy are considered inseparable. Therefore, I refer to this embeddedness as settler-colonial liberal-capitalist democracy. It is significant to note that the concept maintains a strong focus on political economy, which is directly tied to capitalism and labour. That said, liberalism whether classical, laissez-faire and/or semi-representative takes the form of a centralized nation-state that upholds personal autonomy, reasonableness and a liberal society of “like-minded individuals” (Brown 2014, p.1; Hueglin 1994, p. 10). Citizens under this ideological pretext experience “freedom and equality of opportunity” in the form of nation-state control over their living conditions (Hueglin 1994, p. 9 & 10). This means citizens are required to accept a certain level of compromise and subservience to the nation-state (Hueglin 1994, p. 9 & 10). Conversely, some individuals and/or groups experience liberalism not only as “oppressive standardization and conformity’, but also as a form of “peripheral subordination to, and exploitation by, centrally dominant elites” (Hueglin 1994, p.10). Canadian semi-representative liberalism is described by some scholars as “democratic, elite-protecting and rights-based elements and institutions” (Vance 2016, p.1). The latter form of liberalism creates situations of over-and under-representation amongst different group interests, resulting in conflicts over “power and resources” under the pretence of a “general national interest” (Vance 2016, p. 1).\_ Moreover, distinctions are evident between those nation-states adhering to the principle of popular sovereignty and Canadian state formation which support the larger goal of “peace, order and good government” in s.91 of the "

From the lens of semi-representative liberalism, Canadian nation-state formation is cast as an elitist framework that controls the will of the people and protects the interests of the elite (Vance 2016, p.1). This interpretation demonstrates the importance of giving Indigenous political orders a greater voice in a new multi-government arrangement. After all, the original peoples of Canada did not have a say in early nation-state formation, and it was not until 1960 when registered Indians were actually permitted to vote and have their voices heard in Canadian elections.'

Mohawk traditional practice was to adopt outside their race and inter-marry non-Indigenous peoples (Dickson-Gilmore, 1999). Kahnawà:ke members identify as Mohawks and other tribal relationships that include Mohawks marrying other Indigenous peoples are invalidated. Lastly, community members frequently adopt the social practice of eviction. Several middle-aged women at the Golden Age Club expressed the rooted nature of this social condition as follows: “we were all taught… if you marry out, you move out” and “the rules are the rules and people need to conduct themselves accordingly” (Cornacchia, 2010). This policy was recently ruled unconstitutional by Quebec’s Superior Court after Waneek Horn-Miller and 16 other defendants challenged the Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke for upholding the “marry out, get out” provisions found in their membership law (Laframboise 2018).'

This view of reconciliation rebalances community relationships and decolonizes nation-to-nation political and economic relationships. A politics of refusal, if you will, that strives to remedy the historical and contemporary effects of colonialism on Indigenous people and their communities (Alfred and Corntassel 2005; Simpson 2011; Coulthard 2014; Simpson 2014; Moss 2005, p.66). Indigenous culture and values are privileged and there is no effort to align them with European cultures and values (Alfred 2005, p.33; Simpson 2011; Alfred 2009, p. 169; Coulthard 2014; Simpson 2014), 3). The Onkwehonwe and settler-colonial relationship is a nation-to-nation partnership in which co-existence is premised on inter-cultural relationships of sharing and cooperation between autonomous nations (Alfred 2009, p. 169). Reconciliation is closely tied to the restoration of Indigenous peoples humanity, their dignity and spiritual strength, the ecology and a strong economic base with sufficient land that can lead to self-determination (Alfred 2009, p.166). Nonetheless, this reconciliation discourse maintains the existence of a parallel state of Indigenous nationalism within the nation-state setting. The reconciliation approach fails to account for the broader global matrix of power in a colonial-capitalist world-system.'

Reconciliation is realized in these third spaces where Indigenous sovereignty is enacted and Eurocentric theories of culture and categories of identity are critiqued (Battiste 2002; Henderson 2013; Borrows 2007; Coleman 2012; Bhabba, 1994, p. 1). In other words, reconciliation “redefines and redistributes economic and cultural value” in these spaces of resistance (Findlay 2005, p.297). Co-existence is best understood as a “politics of inter-dependency” in which a coalition within a cooperative structure achieves reconciliation (Findlay 2004, p. 29 & p.46). Use of settler-colonial liberal-capitalist democracy’s political and legal structures and processes is encouraged despite Indigenous claims to autonomy. However, this type of reconciliation is distinct from those of anti-colonial and de-colonial views, which both disprove of being embedded within the politics of recognition lifeworld given its racist and sexist foundation.'

Grosfoguel (2011) also suggests that culture and the economy are inter-connected and one should not fall into the trap of arguing about which one comes first (p.18). Lastly, Dussel describes the limitations of Eurocentrism and its civilizing system in terms of ecological destruction, the devastation of humanity and its inability to successfully assimilate Indigenous sub-alterns and their cultures into the logic of modernization. Genuine reconciliation is about protecting nature, requiring equal distribution of wealth and labour amongst people and promoting resistance to assimilative policies and practices.'

Treaties must be approved in Canadian law before they are enforceable at the national-level."

This, in turn, requires the Crown, acting honourably, to participate in processes of negotiation. While this process continues, the honour of the Crown may require it to consult and, where indicated, accommodate Aboriginal interests” (para. 25).

To counter-act these deficiencies, Indigenous remedies proposed to: 1) have Indigenous laws and jurisdiction incorporated into impact assessment governance and planning processes; 2) create a collaborative consent framework for addressing the FPIC requirement; 3) develop flexibility within the review process to more fully include Indigenous “traditions, customs, law and aspirations” throughout the process; and, 4) incorporate Indigenous peoples in all stages of impact assessment decision-making (p.29).'
