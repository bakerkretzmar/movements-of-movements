        text: 'The post -World War II Bretton Woods institutions extended the pre-war colonial order. They exerted northern dominance based on a notion of “superiority” in managing a world order based on a (northern) value-based “rules” oriented international economic order. This dominance was enforced by the overwhelming military and financial power of the north at the time and particularly by US power and its growing legitimacy among other like-minded countries as the “leader of the free world”.'

        text: 'But that was then, and this is now. Today this order is under threat. The global hegemonic construct is undergoing radical change. There has been an accelerating attenuation of the north’s hold on global economic and strategic circumstances. Ironically, this attenuation owes its origin and progress to the very mechanisms that were meant to preserve the northern hegemony like the liberalization of global trade and investment and the spread of pluralistic governance after the demise of communism. These mechanisms sparked the economic rise of the south and the emergence of competing regional powers like China, India and Brazil. The developing world is now more “middle-income” (107 countries in 2019) than “low-income” (31). 72% of the world’s poor live in MICs.'

        text: "The question now is not whether there will be a new world order, but what shape this order will take and what this will mean for the existing neo-colonial global institutions and the North in general, especially if the US and other northern countries continue their retreat from global hegemonic roles and shrink back into the ultra-nationalism and isolationist shells. These anti-globalization movements in the north have been sparked by calculation (differential perceived costs and benefits of integration – the rust-belt syndrome), community fears (the “losers” subscribing to a more exclusive national identity and anxiety over the perceived negative effects of immigration), and cues (images of opinion leaders\_ with partisan attachments and ideological predispositions)."

        text: 'The results of this shakeout will have significant influence on the relevance of the North in the South not only in political and economic terms, but also in the formation of viable development partnerships. A radical question is, does the South really need the North given the emergence of new development actors in the South including donors who are competing for space. There has also been a fundamental switch in the ownership of international development processes from the north to the south.'

        text: "To form appropriate\_ development partnerships, northern institutions will have to figure out who to work with and on what (global public goods, region/country specific issues).\_ Finding the right mechanisms ( like grants, loans, blended finance) and instruments ( like aid agencies, development finance institutions, private sector) will be key. At stake is the north’s continued relevance to assisting in the progress in the south.\_\_"
