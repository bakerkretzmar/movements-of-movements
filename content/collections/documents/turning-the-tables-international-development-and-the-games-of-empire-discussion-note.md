        text: "This is a Discussion Note for an exploratory workshop to initiate dialogue on emerging world politics and (dis)order, to be held at the University of Ottawa on November 5 2019. \_Many of us - as teachers, as researchers, as students, as development practitioners, as activists, and as normal people in our everyday lives (and also in our various identities as women, men, and people of other sexualities, as Indigenous Peoples and as settlers, as people of different colours, faiths, ethnicities, and nationalities, and as Dalits and of other castes) - are already concerned with aspects of these questions; and where it is perhaps also true that we are all, in our own ways and at our own levels, struggling to cope with the swirling and spiralling chaos that has opened up all around us; almost in every sphere of life, and down to interpersonal relations, in our workplaces and in our homes. \_Our objective is to create a space for open, critical, and cross-sectoral engagement with the big picture in our times, and for all of us to look beyond our own horizons; and where we are hopeful that this first workshop may trigger participants to taking related initiatives, perhaps even on a networked basis.\_ Given the stage that they are in their lives, we are very hopeful that this event might especially be of interest to students and to younger people, and where we are attempting to design it accordingly."
