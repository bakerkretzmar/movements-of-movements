        text: 'I could talk to you about the problems in the Mexican preparatory process, but there is no time for that. Let me just say that today, a meeting has been cancelled because the fanatics of the purity of the open space do not want to look for a compromise. The meeting was organised to look for concrete solutions for the existing conflicts, but they do not want solutions. It is an undemocratic and excluding process. We are even accused of conspiracy. This is madness.'

Yet, the political situation today is so very different from then. \_"

Just like two years ago in Salvador, they will try to boycott the Mexican process. And in the same way as two years ago, they will now propose to have some kind of regional or thematic forum.'
