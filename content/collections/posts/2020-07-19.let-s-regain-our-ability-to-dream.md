It forces us to a moment of introspection, of new critical reflection and shared solidarity in political relations and daily life. It invites us to think beyond what we know, or from what we have learned in this moment of global crisis, which has disrupted all forms of economic, social, subjective, emotional and, of course, political connection.'

The Zapatistas call it, accurately, the "collapse of the system", to refer not to a simple crisis, not to an interruption of the existing order in a more or less limited period where, after a while, everything becomes rearranged. It is rather a context of chaos and of climatic and human destruction, expressed in the massive collapse of the dominant system due to its own contradictions, unstoppable aggression against biodiversity, increased injustices and inequalities, hunger, poverty, wars, genocides, ecocides, femicides, state terrorism, and more.'

Also, and dramatically, a denied, naturalized injustice that runs through our lives, our bodies, even our horizons of change: racial injustice, in a scandalous form that is embedded in our societies. The dismay and horror with which the entire world witnessed, live, the murder of George Floyd, a black American citizen, revealed not only the arrogance and unlimited impunity of white supremacy, It also forced us to recognize racism, but endemic, in our societies, in our cultures, in our bodies and territories, deeply rooted in the monopoly of western culture. It was exciting to hear, at the recent Global Assembly for the Amazon, one of the indigenous leaders recovering Floyd''s cry: "The Amazon is crying: I can''t breathe" -'

A normality that wants to continue being and is expressed in a brutal way: obscurantisms, violence, fundamentalisms, violation of human rights, feminicides, extractivisms, and the destruction of the Amazon… All morbid symptoms of the ruthless attempt to continue its “normality” of accumulation by dispossession, of lands, bodies, and territories, and to deepen contempt for human rights and the rights of Mother Earth.'

In doing so, they confront epistemic violence and structural racism that has historically kept them subordinate. "
