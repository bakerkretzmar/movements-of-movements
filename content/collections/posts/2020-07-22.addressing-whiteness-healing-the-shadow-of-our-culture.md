        text: "A request/ invitation: If you are someone who feels discomfort arise in you in hearing the term white supremacy, please don’t turn away. Please read anyways. Please let yourself feel the discomfort, be with it, know that you are not alone and that there is important work to do in just feeling this. Please remember that it pales in comparison to the fear experienced on a daily basis by black, brown and other bodies whose nervous systems are always on high alert, always ready for attack. For those of us with white bodies, we must learn to be with the hard truth that we live in a white supremacist society. That even if we believe ourselves to be conscious and aware, we have to contend with how deep this white supremacy goes, and how each of us is affected and even constituted by it—whether we see it or not. I promise you, sitting with this discomfort, getting curious about it, has a lot of potential for healing.\_\_\_\_\_"

        text: "As I have said a number of times since this pandemic began:\_ this virus is not simply something to be defeated. It, like many illnesses is a teacher, a teacher, whose main method, at least at first is to force us to pause, to look, and hopefully to see. If it feels apocalyptic, remember that etymologically apocalypse comes from the words to un-cover, to reveal. This moment of revelation requires us to take a hard look at what is, and one of the things that is, is a devastating history and present constituted by white supremacy. And white supremacy is not only tied to the KKK, police brutality, etc; it is fundamental to this nation. I will go so far as to say that unless we start to understand and grapple with white supremacy as it really is, embedded in the soil of our culture, we stand little chance of surviving as a species (and sadly we will keep taking many other species down with us).\_"

I know these students aren’t bad or mean, they are simply products of our culture. A culture that is steeped in a zero-sum scarcity mentality. Instead of recognizing that we can all get A’s, people feel that their getting an A is necessarily dependent on others NOT getting one, that if we all got As, the A would be worth less, or something. This is the illness of whiteness and white supremacy (which is inextricably linked to, and constitutive of Capitalism). As I continue to study and witness the depth of the illness that plagues our country (an in different ways other countries), I am repeatedly brought back to this. At the heart of the dominant culture, perhaps best exemplified by the American Dream and the economic myth it depends on, is an almost childlike insecurity and immaturity. And this insecurity goes hand in hand with the erasure of our fundamental interconnection with all that is, and with this, the invisibilization of where true wealth and abundance lie.\_"

But it goes much deeper, and yet that depth is also its ubiquity, the water we swim in, the air we breathe. Something so familiar that we often don’t even recognize it is there—until it is disrupted. Whiteness is a construct premised on domination, separation, objectification, extraction, and creating a classificatory schema for the world in which there is essentially only one right way to be. These concepts are not unique to how we treat Others and if you take a step back, you might recognize them in supposedly less destructive—even supposedly positive— parts of our culture.'

In fact, they are inextricably linked with many things we think of as good. You see, white supremacy is itself part and parcel of the Western Enlightenment project. We can understand it as a part of its shadow. Meaning, it is not simply that racism and the Enlightenment developed around the same time, but rather that they are inextricably linked, intricately woven together and, at times invisibly, part of the same worldview that we may hail as progressive. As Bayo Akomolafe might put it, the soil that grows white supremacy is the same that grows science, rationality, law, order, education, development, progress, growth, even justice. '

        text: "Given this, and the deep entrenchment of white supremacy in everything,\_ I have come to prefer the notion of “healing the shadow of our culture”- to borrow a phrase from Rachel Naomi Remen—over the terms eradicate, destroy or even dismantle. When we start to recognize that at the heart of whiteness is an illness, a painful insecurity and lack of self-love, perhaps we can go about this as the work of healing or tending to a garden. As a healer your main goal is to restore the body’s capacity to find its own balance. As a gardener your goal is to cultivate healthy soil for growing diverse and healthy crops. You don’t want to use pesticides to kill off what you don’t want, because pesticide is poison and has serious side effects. You also don’t want a mono-crop, because having just one thing, always leaves you in danger of blight. You do want to plant in a way that creates the conditions of possibility for diverse things to grow and flourish. You want to inhibit or at least contain the growth of weeds and repel destructive pests, but you do this by learning to crowd them out with beneficial plants.\_ That being said, you want to be clear about what it is you want to grow, and actively work to sow, propagate and care for those. This is not a laissez-faire event. In other words, there is a lot of intentional work to do.\_"

While I understand where the frustration comes from, and respect the right of\_ those bearing the brunt of these inequities to feel frustrated and even angry, I believe the shaming and judgment are both keeping us stuck, and obscuring the ways we are all mired in the cultural baggage of white supremacy. We have to let go of the shame and fear of making mistakes associated with this work. There is a crucial difference between taking responsibility for whiteness, for doing our work, and the kind of white-guilt or shame, that actually makes matters worse."

In fact there has been an invitation for people to get together in “racial affinity groups” – so white people to get together to explore and study whiteness, both as a construct/concept, but also, as an embodied set of experiences and sensations.10 Black people work on their own study, separate at first from bodies that may be threatening—even if on a sub-conscious level. We study and do practices with these sensations, much like we meditate. First we just do our practice and notice. Then we begin to have the possibility to transform.\_"
