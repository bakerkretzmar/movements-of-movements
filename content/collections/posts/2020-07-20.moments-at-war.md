The New Afrikans were but one of many tendencies of the internationalist Black left, asserting that despite centuries since the Middle Passage and creation of a new people on a hostile foreign shore, Black folks in the US had never chosen to be US citizens, and in fact made up a potentially independent nation—which would have to fight the US to survive. Another vital influence was the '

Both of these tendencies and many others share lineage from Minister Malcolm X, who poignantly noted that a people forced to defend themselves for mere survival should never consider that defense a form of violence. “I never call self-defense violence,” Malcolm asserted, “I call it intelligence.”'

Liberal and neoliberal solutions doled out as well-financed offers of cooptation in contrast to the more immediate brutal repression and the creation of new political prisoners and death-cult policies will attract some for sure, but ultimately the pale in the context of the triple crisis of economic collapse, police/military terror, and a health pandemic whose federal response seems growingly to match previous genocidal policies against Black, Brown, and Indigenous peoples on these shores.

But I do note that the US left’s incessant quibbling about theories or tactical divisions may be simmering down. As assassinated Black Panther leader Fred Hampton used to admonish, “it is time to settle our differences.” The question now is ‘Which Side Are You On?’ and what form of militant resistance will you help organize for? If these questions keep being asked, and concrete answers sought in the creation of constructive, alternative programs, positive things may emerge from the belly of the beast in this crisis-laden moment. We can we certain, at least, of two things: Nothing short of an ideologically diverse, non-sectarian, multi-generational, united front connecting a wholistic critique of racist, capitalist patriarchy will build into an effective movement for social change. And no such potentially emerging movement will be led by older males of Euro-American descent whatever their charisma, skills, and access to money or media. This is a Black-led moment, within the US and elsewhere, based not merely on past injustices but on contemporary realities of working-class and social conditions. The leadership of our movements must reflect the realities of our moment.'
