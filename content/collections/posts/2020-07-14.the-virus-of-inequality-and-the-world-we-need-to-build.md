        text: 'The coronavirus pandemic has had a wide and rapid impact on the ways we relate to each other, how we live with each other and work with each other. It is clearly not only a health emergency and its impact on the hundreds of thousands of human lives that have been lost. It is the crisis of a civilization that questions the very foundations of the present economic, political, social, cultural and environmental present model. '

        text: 'This crisis has shown the very essence of capitalism, its need to ensure the accumulation of wealth, power and political control through the super-exploitation of labor and the destruction of nature. It has revealed to us how interconnected it is with patriarchy, racism and colonialism, expressed in poverty, inequality, misogyny, homophobia, lesbophobia ... symptoms of the merciless attempt to continue a type of development "ad infinitum" that consecrates -unviable- ways of life, not only for humanity as a whole, but for the survival of the planet.'

The inequalities that characterize and burden Latin America and the Caribbean, became wider with the pandemic. Its impact on those sectors of the population that have suffered historic exclusions and deprivations, who live in precarious conditions and greater vulnerability, with those who work in the informal sector, those who, because of their age, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnic origin see their possibility of reacting increasingly limited and their rights more and more restricted.

Nevertheless, its resources have been overwhelmed by the sanitary emergency and eroded by the progressive reduction of its regulating role and the reduction of the budgets destined to public health, education and employment. In many instances, the absence of effective mechanisms of control and accountability, have revealed the lack of efficiency and the corruption of politicians and businessmen who restrict the rights of the citizens to the demands of the market.

In various countries, they have been used to repress social movements and protests thus restricting human rights and widening the mechanisms of control ever the population of already weakened democracies.'

Feminism has placed daily life as a dimension of democracy, as a form of organizing social life. It requires narratives, actions, proposals, created in the plurality of practices and the concrete experience of all, women and men, marked by inequalities of class, race, ethnicity, sex and gender.

A model where the "natural" and nurturing role of women becomes the most important and necessary work and productive and reproductive work become shared as a social practi-ce free and full of meaning. Caring is proposed as a universal right, transversal and inter-cultural, it opens the possibility of recapturing such notions as solidarity, reciprocity and interdependency among human beings and human beings and nature. To invent new forms of living, dreaming and preserving feminist life.'
