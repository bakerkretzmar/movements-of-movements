        text: 'This crisis has shown the very essence of capitalism, its need to ensure the accumulation of wealth, power and political control through the super-exploitation of labor and the destruction of nature. It has revealed to us how interconnected it is with patriarchy, racism and colonialism, expressed in poverty, inequality, misogyny, homophobia, lesbophobia ... symptoms of the merciless attempt to continue a type of development "ad infinitum" that consecrates -unviable- ways of life, not only for humanity as a whole, but for the survival of the planet.'

        text: 'Despite the progressive weakening of the States promotion of social and collective rights, the effects of the pandemic have demonstrated that they are fundamental to deal with the crisis and ensure the provision of basic services and social protection. Nevertheless, its resources have been overwhelmed by the sanitary emergency and eroded by the progressive reduction of its regulating role and the reduction of the budgets destined to public health, education and employment. In many instances, the absence of effective mechanisms of control and accountability, have revealed the lack of efficiency and the corruption of politicians and businessmen who restrict the rights of the citizens to the demands of the market.
