So it’s worth thinking seriously about how we talk, who we are talking to, what we would like them to do and how we think our talk contributes to that."

        text: "5.\_\_\_\_\_ We really aren’t short of outrage, or visions, or deep theoretical analyses. There may not be so much of them in the mainstream media, but that is a different problem and one that can’t be resolved by simply producing more of them. Why do we have so much of these, and so little serious thought about our own movements’ action?"

        text: "6.\_\_\_\_\_ By comparison with twenty years ago (before the 2007-8 crash) our movements have almost certainly become more provincial: more focussed on our local nation states and operating within our local cultural framings – and less involved in international and intercontinental alliances."

        text: "8.\_\_\_\_\_ By contrast, we are more dependent on “radical” but profit-making media, “radical” but institutionalised academia, and “radical” celebrity to produce our ideas and as the starting point for our conversations. These “means of mental production” have their own logics, which are not ours."

        type: text
        text: "9.\_\_\_\_\_ One effect of those logics is that outrage, critical theory and visions do rather well – but strategy, and learning from each other’s struggles, are not at a premium. Activists today are much less likely than activists fifty or even twenty years ago to be genuinely familiar with the gains, struggles, defeats and ambiguous victories hard-won elsewhere – and much more likely to repeat those same mistakes because they sell, win clicks or do well on academic CVs."

We have seen some attempts at doing so at a party-political level, most (not all) of which have proven to be weaker than promised."

We are not winning."

The same can be said globally of struggles for women’s and LGBTQ+ rights, for opposition to racism and communalism, for labour struggles and in other movements."

        text: "19.\_ These kinds of alliance-conversations and means of mental production need to come from and speak to movements, not respond to other logics. If they are not “organic”, they will reproduce the problems of commercialised outrage, radical celebrity, critical academic theory – and of talking as though things will simply change because we are hurting and because we want a better world. Other people are happy with how things are and want to keep it that way, or push it further down those tracks – and they are wealthier, more powerful and have higher status than we do."

        text: "20.\_ We have won before and we can win again. Empires have fallen; dictatorships have vanished; ancient traditions have been broken; people have moved from poverty to share the product of their labour; old forms of patriarchy and heteronormativity have been successfully challenged; powerful colonial and racial hierarchies have been undermined; drives to war have been prevented. Of course these victories were often ambiguous – and the more isolated the movements that brought them about, or the more hierarchical the relationships within those movements, the more ambiguous the victories."

If we do not see them as flawed and partial victories, and see ourselves as living in a world partly made by movements, we will at best repeat the mistakes of the past and at worst imagine emancipation as something so far off it can never be achieved in this world."
