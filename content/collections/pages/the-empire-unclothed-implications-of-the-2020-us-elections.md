        text: '“The whole world is watching" can be taken literally in US election years, perhaps never more so than in 2020. This is the case for many reasons, some more obvious than others, all attributable to or consequent on the fact that the US is the most powerful imperial power. But it faces challenges from within and without, most of its own making. Indeed, its chickens have come home to roost. The white supremacy that defines its republic is being challenged from the streets and in popular culture by African Americans, Latinx, Indigenous, other people of color, together with self-defined white progressives and allies. Although the rebellion today recalls a previous, near-decade-long broad challenge, beginning in the 1960s, it confronts a state at once enfeebled by decades of neoliberal globalization and empowered by new surveillance and repressive capacities. Nonetheless, the authoritarian populism of its current administration, including that of its extreme right global counterparts, renders it unable to effectively respond to pandemics, economic dislocations, and climate breakdown. Ineffective or incompetent responses should not suggest unimpactful ones; quite the contrary, the world is being pulverized by the ruling class’s neoliberal and militarist responses to its own inadequacies. The Movements of Movements Conversations, therefore, look globally to activist thinkers and their reactions to the elections, first on October 16, 2020, and then again on November 20, 2020, after the election. These combined web dialogues will together chart the Movements of Movements as people around the world envision and work towards new realities and liberation. Specifically, our objective is to critically discuss the nature and meanings of the US elections this year, and of their implications for the peoples of the US, and the peoples of the world--both colonized and free--and for life on Mother Earth.'
