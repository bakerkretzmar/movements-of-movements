        text: 'It is often said, in relation to elections taking place in the US, that “The whole world is watching." This is perhaps never more so however than this year, in November 2020. This is the case for many reasons, some more obvious than others, but most attributable to or consequent on the fact that the US is the most powerful imperial power. This time, it’s also a function of having a person as president who has swung the country and its politics to the extreme right and normalized a political culture of deceit, manipulation, and abuse – and which is resonating with similar tendencies that have arisen across the world, and especially in sub-imperial powers, as one outcome among many, of neoliberalism.

        text: 'But the US today faces challenges both from within and without, most of its own making. The white supremacy that defines the US republic is today being challenged from the streets and in popular culture by African Americans, Latinx, Indigenous, other people of color, together with self-defined white progressives and allies. Although the rebellion today recalls a previous, near-decade-long broad challenge, the civil rights and Black movements beginning in the 1960s, it confronts a very different state, one that is at once enfeebled by decades of neoliberal globalization and empowered by new surveillance and repressive capacities. Nonetheless, the authoritarian populism of its current administration, just as that of its extreme right global counterparts, renders it uninterested in effectively responding to and addressing pandemics, economic dislocations, and climate breakdown. But saying that they are ineffective or incompetent responses should not suggest that they are unimpactful; quite the contrary, the world as a whole is today being pulverized by the US ruling class’s neoliberal and militarist responses to its own inadequacies.

        text: 'Strategic analysis which centers the building of exchange between people’s movements is the core of Movements of Movements process – of its books, website, and web event series. The Movements of Movements Conversations is therefore now looking to activist thinkers from across the world and their readings of the implications of the US elections, the first on October 16, 2020, before the elections, and the second on November 20, 2020, immediately after the elections. Our objective is to critically discuss the nature and meanings of the US elections this year, and of their implications for the peoples of the US, for the peoples of the world--both colonized and free--and for life on Mother Earth. These combined web dialogues will together chart the Movements of Movements as peoples around the world envision and work towards new realities and liberation.'
